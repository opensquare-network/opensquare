# Bounties Module

The bounties module provide management for bounties. Generally speaking, it facilitate the collaborations between
funders, hunters and the council.

## Basic workflow

1. Funder create a bounty and wait for the council's review.
2. The council may accept or reject the bounty. If accepted, the bounty can be applied by hunters.
3. Funder assign one hunter to the bounty.
4. Hunter do the work and submit it.
5. Funder resolve the bounty and give remark to the hunter. Fund will be sent to hunter wile some fee will be charged by the council.

In the process of 3-4, either the council and funder can close the bounty. Currently no fund or reputation loss for funder to close bounty, we may add ways to setting this in future features.
